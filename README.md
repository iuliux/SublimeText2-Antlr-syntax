---------------

Puts some colors in `.g` and `.g4` ANTLR files and adds a simple build tool.

## Set-up (for the build tool to work)

Make sure that you have the antlr4 alias and the
Java classpath setup (as shown in [antlr.org](http://www.antlr.org/) quickstart)
for the build system to work correctly.

## Install

A simple method to install is to use [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/). From the Package Control [command palette](https://packagecontrol.io/docs/usage), enter "Install Package" and then search for "ANTLR".
